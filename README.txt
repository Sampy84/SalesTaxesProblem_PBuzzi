The Sales Taxes Problem has been solved with a Java application written by using the NetBeans IDE. 
For its solution have been implemented the GOF Design Patterns Singleton and Visitor.
The input data have been coded through three text files handled by the application.

The solution contains:

Run the application:

   Case 1. Double click on the executable jar file;
   Case 2. Open a cmd prompt or a bash shell and run the command "java -jar SalesTaxesProblem_PBuzzi.jar".

Output:

   Case 1. Three new text files will be created, one for each shopping basket containing the specific output;
   Case 2. The outputs will be displayed on the cmd prompt or bash shell and three new text files will be created, one for each shopping basket containing the specific output.
